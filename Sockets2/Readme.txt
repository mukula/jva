This folder contains peer to peer communication.please see programs in Sockets1 folder prior to the one in
this program.

to run,open three command prompts.first start server by in one command prompt,and then run MyClient twice in
two different command prompt.now the messages can be exchanged between two clients.
these programs has some problems as some exceptions are generated in MyServer program after a client ends communication by writing stop.
I have done it intentionally,so that next time i read,i try to remove those errors,by this way i will comprehend the programs throughly.
