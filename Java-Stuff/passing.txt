in java ,primitive data types are passed by value,i.e the copy of value of that argument.In C,we could pass by reference
through which we can change the variable value that was passes as refernce.pass by reference is not allowed in java for
primitive data types.

Java is always pass-by-value. 
Java passes objects as references and those references are passed by value.
in following class,variable st holds the reference to object with value "sai",i.e st has address of String object
"sai".now when we pass st as argument in tot,st is not itself passes,its value is passed,i.e the copy of  address stored 
by st is passes into tot,and then it is stored in String f.so now f also efers to String "sai".It all seems like we ae
passing by refernce,which is not so.

class TotMall{
TotMall(){
String st=new String("sai");
tot(st)
}
void tot(String w)
{
String f=w;
}
}
