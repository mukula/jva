Java Heap Memory

Heap memory is used by java runtime to allocate memory to Objects and JRE classes. 
Whenever we create any object, it’s always created in the Heap space.
Garbage Collection runs on the heap memory to free the memory used by objects that doesn’t have any reference.
Any object created in the heap space has global access and can be referenced from anywhere of the application
 
Java Stack Memory
it contain method specific values that are short-lived and references to other objects in the heap that are getting referred 
from the method. 
Stack memory is always referenced in LIFO (Last-In-First-Out) order. 
Whenever a method is invoked, a new block is created in the stack memory for the method to hold local primitive values
and reference to other objects in the method. As soon as method ends, the block becomes unused and become available for next method.
Stack memory size is very less compared to Heap memory.Java Stack memory is also used for execution of a thread.
