in java,objects that longer are needed are treated as garbage.garbage collection is the process of removing such
garbage and freeing the memory.thus its a kind of memory recycling.	its done automatically by jvm's garbage collector
 so that it doesnot increase the workload of developer,but in this way it adds overhead that can affect the program
 perfromance.
 
 Garbage Collection Algorithms

Any garbage collection algorithm must do two basic things. First, it must detect garbage objects.
Second, it must reclaim the heap space used by the garbage objects and make the space available again to the program 

Generally an object becomes eligible for garbage collection in Java on following cases:

1) All references of that object explicitly set to null e.g. object = null

2) Object is created inside a block and reference goes out scope once control exit that block.

3) Parent object set to null.


finalize() method

The finalize() method is invoked each time before the object is garbage collected. This method can be used to perform cleanup processing. This method is defined in Object class as:

protected void finalize(){}  


gc() method

The gc() method is used to invoke the garbage collector to perform cleanup processing. 
The gc() is found in System and Runtime classes.it can be used to free up space by writing System.gc();
public static void gc(){}
