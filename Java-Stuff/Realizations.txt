1) how does statements like Aa.bb().cc() works??

normally,we think that bb() is a function of object Aa,so how a function can have function in side it?well,it's not so...what happens is bb() returns object of
some class,not primitive data type,and cc() is function of that object returned.

static imports?

2) to write data to sockets,use of printwriter is suggested,and to read,buffered reader is suggested.
