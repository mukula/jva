the reference variables of parent class can refer to child class object,but they can't access the methods of
child classes which are not defined in them(parent class).for eg: two classes implement a interface "In" and both 
overrides the method "com".both have their own body,now if refernce of "In" is able to call method of both
child classes and if it calls com(),then there will be confusion on which methid to call among two child classes.
